      <h1 id="what-is-tretinoin">What is tretinoin?</h1>
      <p>
        Tretinoin is a prescription-only vitamin A derivative (a retinoid) used on the skin to treat
        acne and signs of photo-ageing such as fine lines and uneven texture. It is sometimes known
        as all-trans retinoic acid, and has been used in dermatology for several decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike over-the-counter retinol creams, tretinoin is already in its “active” form. That is one
        reason it is more potent – and why it requires a prescription in many countries.
      </p>

      <h2 id="benefits">Main evidence-based benefits</h2>
      <p>
        Research on topical tretinoin has focused mainly on two areas: acne and photo-ageing
        (sun-related skin changes). In both fields, it is one of the most studied topical treatments.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Acne:</strong> helps prevent new comedones (clogged pores), makes existing ones less
          sticky and supports long-term control when used consistently with other appropriate measures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Photo-ageing:</strong> over months, tretinoin can improve fine lines, rough texture and
          pigmentation unevenness caused by chronic sun exposure – when combined with daily sunscreen.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintenance:</strong> some people continue on lower-frequency tretinoin after acne
          improves, to help maintain results. This should always be guided by a prescriber.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-it-works">How tretinoin works in the skin</h2>
      <p>
        Tretinoin binds to specific receptors in skin cells and changes how those cells behave. In simple
        terms, it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>speeds up how quickly cells in the outer layer of the skin are replaced,</li>
        <li>reduces how easily dead cells and oil stick together inside pores, and</li>
        <li>influences collagen production and skin structure over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These changes are gradual. Many people notice more irritation before they see clearer or smoother
        skin – which is why dermatologists emphasise a gentle routine and realistic expectations.
      </p>

      <h2 id="side-effects">Common side effects and “purging”</h2>
      <p>
        The most frequently reported side effects in the first weeks and months of tretinoin use include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>redness, burning or stinging,</li>
        <li>dryness and flaking,</li>
        <li>temporary increase in visible breakouts (“purging”), and</li>
        <li>increased sensitivity to sunlight.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These effects are usually dose- and frequency-dependent. Doctors often start with a lower strength,
        less frequent application and a simple supporting routine (gentle cleanser, moisturiser, sunscreen).
      </p>
      <p>
        Severe pain, swelling, blistering or eye irritation are not typical and should prompt medical review.
      </p>

      <h2 id="who-should-avoid">Who should avoid or be cautious with tretinoin?</h2>
      <p>
        Whether tretinoin is appropriate is always an individual clinical decision. In many guidelines,
        extra caution or avoidance is advised in people who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>are pregnant, planning pregnancy or breastfeeding,</li>
        <li>have very sensitive or barrier-damaged skin (for example severe eczema),</li>
        <li>have a history of severe sun sensitivity or use other photosensitising medicines,</li>
        <li>are already on strong acne treatments (such as oral isotretinoin), or</li>
        <li>cannot reliably use daily sunscreen.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are examples only. Your own doctor or dermatologist will look at the full picture of your
        health, medicines and lifestyle.
      </p>

      <h2 id="tretinoin-vs-retinol">Tretinoin vs cosmetic retinol</h2>
      <p>
        Many over-the-counter creams use the word “retinol” in their marketing. It can be helpful to know
        the differences:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Tretinoin:</strong> active retinoic acid, prescription-only in many regions, studied in
          formal medical trials.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Retinol / retinal / other cosmetic retinoids:</strong> used in skincare products at a
          range of strengths, usually with milder but still meaningful effects over time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some people start with cosmetic retinoids, then move to tretinoin later under medical guidance.
        Others stay with non-prescription products because that balance of results vs irritation feels right.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

      <h3>How often is tretinoin usually applied?</h3>
      <p>
        Typical regimens might start at a few nights per week and slowly build up, but exact instructions
        vary widely. Only your own prescriber can tell you what to do with the specific product you are
        given.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I use acids (AHA/BHA) or vitamin C with tretinoin?</h3>
      <p>
        Combining many strong actives can increase the risk of irritation. Some routines separate
        exfoliating acids and vitamin C from tretinoin by time of day or alternate days. This should be
        planned with a professional who knows your skin and products.
      </p>
